# The Great Gatsby Bootcamp

This repository represents my first interaction with Gatsby (Static Site Generator for React.js), as I followed this camp through Andrew Mead's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) on YouTube in February of the year 2020.

I stopped when the Contentful (Headless CMS) section started.
